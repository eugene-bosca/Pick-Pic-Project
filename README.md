An app that lets users curate their favourite moments with photo albums. The app creates *events*, shared albums that users invite each other to. These albums integrate with the native Android photo apps for seamless album creation and storage. Users can then rank photos using a swipe-based interface, similar to Tinder. Users can either swipe on individual photos or choose between two randomly selected images. Using an ELO-like ranking system, the app generates a list of top photos, which users can selectively choose from to create an album, or download premade "best-of" albums (e.g., top 20 photos). Additionally, the app can detect and group similar photos, allowing users to rank them, with the highest-rated becoming the representative photo for broader comparison.
